Hi, Welcome to my page on Github. <br />
My name is Rio. I am a software engineer and also a mentor as a hobby. Since graduating from the State Polytechnic of Batam in 2016, I've worked in a variety of companies on tasks ranging from developing a desktop application to assessing and analyzing vulnerabilities. Now I'm learning to be a Fullstack Developer using React, Laravel, and other technologies...
